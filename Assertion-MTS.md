# Real Me (MTS) Assertion Service - Azure AD B2C integration

This projects explains how to configure Real Me as a SAML identity provider into Azure AD B2C. It uses Azure AD B2C custom policies.

In this tutorial:

- RealMe is treated as an external identity provider (IdP).
- The only configured IdP is RealMe and we don't ask user to provide any futher information so from a user perspective there is no interaction with Azure AD B2C. To configure more complex user journey, please refer to the [Useful links section](#useful-links)

## Creating an Azure AD B2C Tenant

Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant) to:

- Create a new Azure AD B2C tenant
- Link your Azure AD B2C tenant to a subscription

## Creating Signing and Encryption Keys

Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-get-started-custom#add-signing-and-encryption-keys) to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as the global administrator of your Azure AD B2C tenant.
2. Make sure you're using the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant. Click the **Directory and subscription filter** in the top menu and choose the directory that contains your tenant.
3. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
4. On the Overview page, select **Identity Experience Framework**.

### Create a signing key used to sign the id_token return by Azure AD B2C

1. Select **Policy Keys** and then select **Add**.
2. For **Options**, choose `Generate`.
3. In **Name**, enter `TokenSigningKeyContainer`. The prefix `B2C_1A_` will be added automatically.
4. For **Key type**, select `RSA`.
5. For **Key usage**, select `Signature`.
6. Click **Create**.

### Create an encryption key used to encrypt the refresh_token return by Azure AD B2C

1. Select **Policy Keys** and then select **Add**.
2. For **Options**, choose `Generate`.
3. In **Name**, enter `TokenEncryptionKeyContainer`. The prefix `B2C_1A_` will be added automatically.
4. For **Key type**, select `RSA`.
5. For **Key usage**, select `Encryption`.
6. Click **Create**.

### Upload the certificate used between Azure AD B2C and RealMe to exchange data

For the MTS environment integrators can obtain a bundle that contains keys and metadata to integrate.  

In the real word environment a private key and public key pair would be generated by the integrating Azure AD B2C tenant and the public key sent to RealMe to configure the 'circle of trust' settings on the RealMe side.
However, to make testing the integration easier in the MTS environment RealMe provides a pre-integrated set of keys (public-private key pair) that integrators can accept and reuse to get up an running quickly. These keys are already pre-trusted in the RealMe MTS environment. It also assumes that of course no sensitive information is exchanged between the MTS RealME and your integrating site.

1. Download the `Integration-Bundle-MTS-VX.X.zip` from the [RealMe Developer Website](https://developers.realme.govt.nz/try-it-out-now/) and unzip it.
2. Rename the file `mts_mutual_ssl_sp.p12` to `mts_mutual_ssl_sp.pfx`.
3. Select **Policy Keys** and then select **Add**.
4. For **Options**, choose `Upload`.
5. In **Name**, enter `SamlMessageSigning`. The prefix B2C_1A_ might be added automatically.
6. In **File upload**, select the `mts_mutual_ssl_sp.pfx` file.
7. In **Password**, enter the password of the certificate (you can find this information in the `readme.txt` file in the `Integration-Bundle-MTS-VX.X.zip` zipped file)
8. Click **Create**.

## Customising the Custom Policies Files

The policies files used in this tutorial have been modified from the [SocialAndLocalAccounts](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack/tree/master/SocialAndLocalAccounts) starter pack.

To know more about policies files, you can read the associated documentation: [Policy files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-overview-custom#policy-files)

1. Download these files:

- [TrustFrameworkBase.xml](./RealMe-Assertion-MTS/TrustFrameworkBase.xml)
- [TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml](./RealMe-Assertion-MTS/TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml)
- [SignUpSignInRealMeAssertion.xml](./RealMe-Assertion-MTS/SignUpSignInRealMeAssertion.xml)

2. In these files, replace these parameters and save the files.:

- `yourtenant` with the name of your B2C tenant (without the `.onmicrosoft.com`)
- `yourEntityID` with a valid RealMe Issuer (see [RealMe request parameters](https://developers.realme.govt.nz/how-realme-works/realme-request-parameters)) in this format `https://www.agencyname.govt.nz/context/application-name`

3. Update the RealMe Login SAML Metadata

- From the `Integration-Bundle-MTS-VX.X.zip` (See previous step), open the `MTSIdPAssertSAMLMetadata.xml` file.
- Copy the content of the file (do not copy the `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>` line).
- Open the `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml` and past here:

    ```xml
    <Item Key="PartnerEntity"><![CDATA[
    Add RealMe Metadata Here
    ]]>
    ```

- Save your changes.

5. Upload the Policies:

- On the Custom Policies page of Identity Experience Framework, select **Upload Policy**.
- In this order, upload `TrustFrameworkBase.xml`, `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml`, `SignUpSignInRealMeAssertion.xml`.

## Upload the B2C Metadata File to RealMe

1. Download the B2C metadata file (replace `yourtenant` with the name of your B2C tenant):
  `https://yourtenant.b2clogin.com/yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com/B2C_1A_SignUpSignInRealMeAssertion/samlp/metadata?idptp=RealMeAssertion-SAML2`

- If you want to use the `login.microsoftonline.com` domain, download the metadata file from this url (replace `yourtenant` with the name of your B2C tenant):
  `https://login.microsoftonline.com/te/yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com/B2C_1A_SignUpSignInRealMeAssertion/samlp/metadata?idptp=RealMeAssertion-SAML2`

2. Open the file and remove the `<Signature>...</Signature>` tag.

3. Browse this url: <https://mts.realme.govt.nz/realme-mts/metadata/import.xhtml>

- Select the metadata file you want to upload then click **Validate**.
- If the file is valid, you can click **Import**.
- On the next page, click **Import** then **Continue**.
- Update your configuration: <https://mts.realme.govt.nz/realme-mts/metadata/updateconfiguration.xhtml>
- Select `yourEntityID` in the **entity ID** field.
- Select `JWT Opaque Token` in the **Opaque Token Return Type** dropdown.
- Select the fields you need to be returned.
- Click **Submit**.

## Testing the Policy

To test the policy, create an application registration in the B2C.
The configuration will direct the response to be send to <https://jwt.ms/>.  
This is a Microsoft developer tool site that allows the raw SAML response to be viewed and understood.

1. In the B2C Tenant, Click on **Identity Experience Framework**.
2. Click on **Applications**.
3. On the application page, click on **Add**
4. On the application creation page
    - Enter `jwt.ms` in the **Name** field.
    - Select `Yes` for **Include web app / web API**
    - Select `Yes` for **allow implicit flow**
    - Enter `https://jwt.ms/`
    - Click on **Create**

5. On the  **Identity Experience Framework**, select the `B2C_1A_SignUpSignInRealMeAssertion` policy:
6. The previously created application should be preselected with the select `jwt.ms` in the **Select application** dropdown.
7. Select the domain you want to use. This should be the based on the metadata file you've uploaded to RealMe (see step above)
8. Click on the **Run now** button, you will be redirected to RealMe
9. On the RealMe website, fill the IVs attributes then click on `Initiate SAML Response`, it will redirect you to the <https://jwt.ms/> website.

You can inspect the token returned by B2C:

- The **sub** claim contains the B2C `objectid`.
- The **idp** claim contains the B2C `realme.govt.nz`.
- The **safeB64Identity** claim contains the RealMe `Verified Identity`.
- The **safeB64Address** claim contains the RealMe `Verified Address`.
- The **rcmsOpaqueToken** claim contains the RealMe `RCMS opaque token`.
- The **issuerUserId** and **fit** claims will be returned correctly once integrated in the RealMe ITE environment.

## Decoding the Verified Identity and Address

The verified identity and address is returned as SAML attributes that are safe base64 encoded JSON payloads. These payloads can be passed back as-is as claims strings for the application to decode. Alternatively, the parsing of the base64 encoded JSON strings can also occur in the Azure AD B2C custom policy with the addition of the following extension logic.

To decode the identity and address as part of the B2C journey, you can refer to this link that describes how to add an REST API connection into the custom policy flow.

- [Walkthrough: Integrate REST API claims exchanges in your Azure AD B2C user journey as validation on user input](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-rest-api-validation-custom)

Then you can use this code snippet to decode the safe base64 identity and address (in C#):

```C#
using System;
using System.Text;
...
private static string ConvertFromSafeBase64String(string safeb64)
{
  // See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548#section-4
  var base64 = safeb64.Replace("-", "+").Replace("_", "/");
  return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(base64));
}
```

Refer to this link for further more complete documentation on [how to decode RealMe identity claims](./Decoding-RealMe-Claims.md).
